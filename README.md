# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA
I Collaborated with UNP to develop a Power BI dashboard for supply chain analysis. It visualizes key metrics like sales, stock levels, shipping costs, supplier performance, and defect rates, enhancing decision-making and logistics efficiency.The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as revenue by product type, sales vs. availability, stock levels, and total sales by SKU. It also tracks shipping costs by transportation mode and carrier, average shipping times, and total lead times. Additionally, it analyzes supplier performance, defect rates, production volume by inspection results, and cost breakdowns. By integrating these insights, the dashboard enhances decision-making, optimizes logistics, and improves overall supply chain efficiency.
